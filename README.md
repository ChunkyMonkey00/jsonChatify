(so exciting, I know)

## What's This?

Welcome to Chatify, a project born from equal parts ambition and frustration with reality itself. This is the chat app that no one asked for but you’ll secretly be glad it exists. Imagine Discord, but stripped down to its raw, unpolished core—yet with more personality and barely-held-together CSS than any sane developer should tolerate.

## Why Does This Exist?

Because why not? Also, who needs to pay for Slack or suffer through a barebones IRC when you can have *this*? Built with the blood, sweat, and tears of developers that may or may not have cussed out CSS one too many times, Chatify is here to make you question your life choices while also keeping you connected. It’s got dark mode, subtle purple accents, and exactly 0 unnecessary features. Seriously, this chat app is as minimal as it gets while still pretending to be functional.

## Features (if you can call them that):

- **Instant Messaging:** Yeah, it’s a chat app, so this one’s kind of implied.
- **Modern Dark Mode:** Because nobody should be blinded by their screen at 3 a.m.
- **Rounded Corners for Days:** We made everything curvy because squares are for people who take life too seriously.
- **Presence Notifications:** Automatically tells everyone when you join the chat… whether they care or not.
- **Themed UI:** Subtle purple and green, inspired by… well, someone’s color blindness? Who knows.

## Tech Stack:

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** The holy trinity of web dev that somehow manages to work together.
- **PieSocket API:** Because we’re not going to reinvent the wheel when someone else already did the hard work.

## How To Run This (If You Dare):

1. Clone the repo (like the pro you are):  
   `git clone https://github.com/chunkymonkey00/jsonChatify.git`

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. ???
   
4. Behold the magic. Or the bugs. Whichever comes first.

## Contributing

Contribute at your own risk. This is the wild west of chat apps—things might break, melt, or spontaneously combust. We welcome PRs though (we might even review them someday).

Enjoy the madness.
